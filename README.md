## üì± Technologies Used

![tech](assets/tech.png)

EventX is a very advanced platform making use of various decentralised technologies to give the best experience. Some of the technologies used are:

- **Biconomy**
  - Easy onboarding of web2 users onto web3
  - Gasless Transactions
  - One EOA, multiple Smart Account system (a very niche usecase that we have implemented)
  - Batch transactions with one click
  - EventX is capable to call other contracts such as push protocol, by minting, staking and calling contracts across chains with a single click
  - Unique: EventX has a custom built a wrapper around the Biconomy SDK for seemless integration into the dApp
  
- **Push Protocol**
  - Helps Organisers stay in touch with their users all times
  - one-to-one networking chat enabled for in-event experience
  - UNIQUE: Automated the whole process of creating a EPNS Channel via direct EPNS Proxy contract calls
  - Bought out unique ways of using group notification system in Push Protocol going beyond notifications
  - Proof: 0x622362982352f9605391cc253ea6ce5977455121bbe3447c26391dc640bdc410 txn hash on Gorelli

- **Etherum Account Abstraction** 
  - We use ERC4337 and a SWC (Smart Wallet Contract) to make Account abstracted contract calls
  - We currently are using the alt-mempool to sign and commit to all transactions
  - This makes EventX a very modern Ethereum Dapp that adheres with more privacy and safer norms and also makes it easier to onboard web3 users

- **NFTPort**
  - EventX uses NFTPort to deply NFTs and manage them
  - EventX specifically uses the NFTCollection Deployment of NFTs for ticketing
  - One of EventX's major tooling is NFT Tickets, and NFTPort helps organiser of these events, make/mint/deploy/manage NFT Collections with ease via EventX and NFTPort
  - We also built a custom wrapper around NFTPort APIs, which will be opensourced soon, so that other dapps can integrated NFTPort in a faster and smoother way

- **Revise**
  - EventX has many features where onchain mutation of NFT is required, hence we are using Revise here
  - We required a git like system to track and mutate changes 

- **Infura**
  - EventX uses Infura as thier choice of RPCs to interact and read Contract Data
  - EventX also heavily uses the `ipfs-http-client` to upload and pin data to IPFS

- **IPFS/Filecoin**
  - EventX heavily uses IPFS to store metadata and NFT assets on the decentralised internet
  - We also heavily rely on push protocol's notifications and chat features, which is a stored in a highly secure manner on IPFS
